# [Project 1: Decision Tree Binary Classification (Python)](https://github.com/THouwe/classification_decisionTrees_shippingData_Python)

This [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/THouwe/classification_decisionTrees_shippingData_Python/blob/main/shippingData_decisionTree.ipynb) shows how to perform model selection for decision trees in binary classification problems. Specifically, it focuses on deciding on whether to (i) over-/under-sample the data in case of imbalanced datasets, (ii) use gini or entropy as information gain criterion, and (iii) limiting tree depth. It uses this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prachi13/customer-analytics).

It is divided in the following sections:

- A. Decision Tree (DT): Summary
- B. Data inspection & preparation
- C. Model selection
- D. Model predictions & interpretation

# [Project 2: Sentiment Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/THouwe/NLP_sentimentAnalysis_BTC_Python)

This [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/THouwe/NLP_sentimentAnalysis_BTC_Python/blob/main/BTC_sentiment_analysis.ipynb), shows how to download and preprocess 100.000 Bitcoin (BTC) tweets from 2022-11-01 to 2022-11-15 to perform sentiment analysis to gather market intelligence. The aim of the analysis is to understand what are peopleâ€™s opinions about Bitcoin tweets (i.e., to extract subjectivity and sentiment polarity from text data).

Web scraping is done using [snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape). \
Filtering for English language is done using [langdetect](https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect). \
Sentiment analysis is done using [spacytextblob](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/spacytextblob).

It is divided in the following sections:

- A. Web scraping
- B. Text preprocessing
- C. Sentiment analysis

# [Project 3: Time-Series Forecast (R)](https://github.com/THouwe/timeSeriesForecasting_waterInflow_R)
This [R Markdown](https://github.com/THouwe/timeSeriesForecasting_waterInflow_R/blob/main/WaterFlow_Sector229.Rmd) shows how to pre-process and analyze time-series (TS) data. The file shows how to explore seasonalities (e.g., autocorrelation) and trends (e.g., moving averages), and how to perform automated model selection using the [Fable library](https://fable.tidyverts.org/). A description in Italian is provided in [this html file](https://github.com/THouwe/timeSeriesForecasting_waterInflow_R/blob/main/WaterFlow_Sector229.html).

# [Project 4: Online Speech Data Collection (JavaScript)](https://github.com/THouwe/timeSeriesForecasting_waterInflow_R)
This repo contains the code for a full online speech recognition experiment using JavaScript and the [JSpsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/) library. Speech and text data recorded from the user's browser and are sent to Dropbox's API. The experiment was originally deployed in [Heroku](https://articulatorycontroldemo.herokuapp.com/). However, link is broken due to changes in Heroku's policies. Will be hosted elsewhere soon.
